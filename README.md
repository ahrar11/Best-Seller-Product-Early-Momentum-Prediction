# Best-Seller-Product-Early-Momentum-Prediction
Using the Olist Brazilian e-commerce dataset this project builds a product level model that predicts whether a new product will fall into the top 10% by units sold in its first 60 days and segments products into early momentum profiles based on the ratio of sales, using only features available in the first 7 days to see their performance over time.
