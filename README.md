# Best Seller Product Early Momentum Prediction
For a marketplace where a small share of products drives most of the revenue, the business needs not only to predict which new products will become top performers within their first few
days of launch, but also to understand how they build that performance over time. Using the Olist Brazilian e-commerce dataset, this project builds a product-level model that predicts
whether a new product will fall into the top 10% by units sold in its first 60 days and segments products into early-momentum profiles based on the ratio of sales, using only features available in the first 7–14 days.
